I've updated this because it was a rushed assignment and was very incomplete.

## How to use

Each time it detects a shake, the number goes up, and a fun melody plays every N powers of 10 (up to 10000).

You can toggle Mini Mode on and off with the A button.
When Mini Mode is on, it uses icon animations instead of numbers.

The B button toggles the LEDs on and off.

A+B to reset the count.
